# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Description
This projects tries to recreate the game tic-tac-toe using react.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this project locally
2. Make sure you are running a local testing server. I recommend http-server.
3. Open the index.html y a web browser and you will be able to test the project.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Don't let the user choose the same square again. This can be done by checking the state of the variable filled, if it is true, then just return.
- Restart the game when it is over. Once the function checkForWinner has found the winner, ask the user if they want to play again, if true, restart the game.
